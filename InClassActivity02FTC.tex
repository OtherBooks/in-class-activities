\textbf{Purpose:} To understand the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, i.e., what is the relationship between the definite integral (signed area) of the velocity function of a moving object and its position? How can we leverage this relationship to calculate areas under curved functions?  \\

\textbf{Knowledge/Skills and Criteria for Success:} After this activity you should be able to

\begin{enumerate}[A.]
	\item explain in your own words what the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says
	\item understand the relationship between velocity, position and signed area under velocity function.
	\item graph the position function given the velocity function
	\item 
	\item 
	
\end{enumerate}

\begin{questions}

\question \textbf{Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.} Write an example illustrating each part by filling the blanks. Let $f(x)$ be continuous on $[a, b]$. We have

\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	
	\item $F(x) = \int_{a}^x f(t) dt$ is an antiderivative of $f(x)$. In other words
	\[ F'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{a}^x f(t) dt \right) = f(x). \]
	

	\hfill \break
$f(t) =$ \hspace{0.5in} $a = $ \hspace{0.2 in} $b = $ \hspace{0.2in} $F(x) = $ \hspace{1.5in} $F'(x) = $ \hspace{0.5in} $F'(3) = $
	\hfill \break
	
	\item If $G(x)$ is \emph{any} antiderivative of $f(x)$ (i.e., a function such that $G'(x) = f(x)$), then $G(x) = F(x) + C = \int_{a}^x f(t) dt + C$ and 
	\[ \int_{a}^b f(t) dt = G(b) - G(a) =: G(x)\bigg\rvert_a^b\]


\hfill \break
$G(x)= $ \hspace{1in} $\displaystyle \int_{a}^b f(t) dt = $
\hfill \break

\end{enumerate}

\question Suppose $f(x)$ is differentiable. Then $\displaystyle \int_0^x f'(t) dt = f(x)$ is

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	
	\item Always true
	
	\item Sometimes true
	
	\item Never true
	
\end{enumerate}






\question Let $\displaystyle F(x) = \int_{-5}^x t^2+\sin(t) dt$. Find the following.

	\item $F\rq{}(x) = $
	
	\hfill \break

	\item $F\rq{}(\pi) = $
	
	\hfill \break
		
	\item $\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}\left(F(\sin(x))\right) = $
	
	\hfill \break
	
	\item $\frac{d}{dx}\left(\int_{\ln(x)}^{\sin(x)} t^2+\sin(t) dt \right) = $

\question Let $v(t)$ be the velocity of a particle moving in a straight path on $[0,6]$. Assume that the position $S(t)$ of the particle was 0 units at the start, i.e., $S(0) = 0$.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	
		
	\item At what time was the particle the furthest away from the starting point? How far is that approximately?
	
	\hfill \break
	\hfill \break
	\hfill \break
	
	
	\item Describe when is $S(t)$ increasing, decreasing, concave up, or concave down on the interval $[0,6]$.
	
	\hfill \break
	\hfill \break
	\hfill \break
	
	\item Sketch the graph of $S(t)$ on the interval $[0,6]$ in on the same picture above. 
	
	
\end{enumerate}

\question Graph $f(t) = -t^2+4$ on $[0, 2]$. Let $g(x) = \int_0^x f(t) dt$. Then for $x$ on $(0, 2)$, $g(x)$ is 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	
	\item increasing and concave up.
	
	
	\item increasing and concave down.
