\begin{questions}
	
\question Recall the \textbf{Divide and Conquer} strategy:

\begin{enumerate}[Step 1.]
	\item Divide the larger problem into smaller \emph{similar} parts/slices.
	\item Solve it for a general representative of those parts/slices.
	\item Sum up the solution of those parts/slices using summation notation.
	\item Rewrite the sum as a Riemann sum.
	\item Take the limit to form the corresponding definite integral.
	\item Use various calculus techniques to solve it. 
\end{enumerate}


\question Suppose a scientist is studying the behavior of a whale. She put a GPS tracker on it to track how much it swims per day. One day, the whale was right by her boat. We'll use this as time $t=0$. After 1 hour the whale was 3 miles North. At $t = 2$ it was 2 mile East and 4 miles North; at $t = 3$ it was 4 miles East and 4 miles North, and at time $t = 7$ the whale had returned to the starting position. Graph the path of the whale and estimate its total length.

\question The whale in the previous problem didn't really swim in a straight line most likely, so the scientist may be able to get a better approximation of the total length of the trip by checking the GPS more often. Our Divide and Conquer strategy is essentially the same. Use it to find the exact arc-length of a continuously differentiable function $y = f(x)$ for $x$ between $x = a$ and $x = b$. Why do we need $f(x)$ to be continuously differentiable?\\

	\item $\displaystyle \int_0^{2\pi}\cos(x)dx.$  
	\item $\displaystyle \int_0^{2\pi}\sqrt{1+\cos^2(x)} dx.$
	\item None of the above.

\question The path of a whale most likely won't be a function of latitude nor longitude, but each coordinate will be a function of time $t$, that is the position can be described by a parametric equation $(x(t), y(t))$. Which of the following is the parametric equation arc-length formula for the time interval $[a, b]$?

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $\displaystyle \int_a^b \sqrt{1+\left(y'(t)\right)^2}dt$
\item $\displaystyle \int_a^b \sqrt{1+\left(\frac{y'(t)}{x'(t)}\right)^2}dt$
\item $\displaystyle \int_a^b \sqrt{\left(x'(t)\right)^2+\left(y'(t)\right)^2}dx$
\item None of the above.

\question Use the parametric formula for arc-length to find the length of the curve given by $x(t) = \cos(t)$ and $y(t) = \sin(t)$ over the interval $[0, 2\pi]$. See if you can do it in your head and find the answer without writing it down.

\question How much work do you do when drinking water in a cola glass using a straw to a point 3 inches above the top edge of the glass? Assume that the function $x = f(y)$ on $[0, 4]$ models the side edge of a cola glass with the bottom on the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis pointing vertically, and that the weight density of water is 62.5 pounds/ft$^3$ = 0.5787 ounces/in$^3$.

\question  A trough is 3 meters long, 2 meters wide, and 1 meters deep. The vertical cross-section of the trough parallel to an end is shaped like an isosceles triangle (with height 1 meters, and base, on top, of length 2 meters). The trough is full of water (density 1000 kg/m$^3$). Find the amount of work in joules required to empty the trough by pumping the water over the top. (Note: Use $g=9.8$ m/s$^2$ as the acceleration due to gravity.)
